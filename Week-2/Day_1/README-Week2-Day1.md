# Week2-Day1: Data Structures â€“ Arrays and Lists in JavaScript

## Overview
This folder contains JavaScript programs demonstrating the use of arrays and lists, as part of the Week 2, Day 1 lesson on problem-solving and algorithms during the Agnirva Web Development Internship.

Arrays and lists are essential data structures for storing and manipulating collections of data in web development. They power functionality such as user inputs, product listings, sorting, filtering, and more.

## Files Included

| File Name                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `basicArrays.js`          | Shows how to declare and access elements from a JavaScript array |
| `arrayOperations.js`      | Demonstrates array methods for adding, removing, searching, and looping |
| `findLargest.js`          | Finds the largest number in a list of values |
| `findLargestWeb.js`       | Outputs the largest number on a webpage using DOM manipulation |
| `advancedArrayOps.js`     | Demonstrates sorting, reversing, and using map to transform array values |
| `evenCount.js`            | Counts the even numbers in an array |
| `removeDuplicates.js`     | Removes duplicate values from an array using a Set |
| `reverseWithoutReverse.js`| Reverses an array manually without using the built-in reverse() method |

## How to Test the Code

You can test the scripts using either of these methods:

### Method 1: Browser Console
1. Open your browser.
2. Right-click and choose "Inspect".
3. Go to the Console tab.
4. Copy and paste the content of any .js file to see the output.

### Method 2: Node.js
1. Make sure Node.js is installed.
2. Save the `.js` files in a local folder.
3. Open terminal and navigate to that folder.
4. Run the scripts using:

```
node filename.js
```

Example:
```
node findLargest.js
```

## Sample Output Examples

### findLargest.js
```
The largest number is: 50
```

### evenCount.js
```
Even numbers count: 3
```

### removeDuplicates.js
```
Unique list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### reverseWithoutReverse.js
```
Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
