# 📁 Week2-Day2: Sorting and Searching Algorithms in JavaScript

## 🧠 Overview
This folder contains JavaScript implementations of basic **sorting** and **searching algorithms** covered in Week 2, Day 2 of our problem-solving curriculum. These are fundamental techniques used in web development for efficient data handling in tasks like:

- Filtering and ranking products on e-commerce sites  
- Real-time search bars  
- Sorting leaderboards or scores  
- Optimizing UI and performance

## 📄 Files Included

| File Name                   | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `bubbleSort.js`            | Implements Bubble Sort algorithm with comments and sample output |
| `builtinSort.js`           | Demonstrates JavaScript's built-in `sort()` method |
| `linearSearch.js`          | Implements Linear Search algorithm |
| `binarySearch.js`          | Implements Binary Search (works only on sorted arrays) |
| `combinedSearchSort.js`    | Combines Bubble Sort and Binary Search into one program |

## 🧪 How to Test the Code

You can test the `.js` files in two simple ways:

### ✅ Option 1: Using the Browser Console
1. Open your browser.
2. Right-click → Inspect → Console tab.
3. Copy-paste any `.js` file content into the console to see the result.

### ✅ Option 2: Using Node.js
1. Save each script in its respective `.js` file.
2. Open terminal in the `Week2-Day2` folder.
3. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   node bubbleSort.js
   node binarySearch.js
   ```

## 📌 Sample Output Examples

### `bubbleSort.js`
```
Sorted list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

### `linearSearch.js`
```
Target found at index 2
```

### `binarySearch.js`
```
Target found at index 3
```

### `combinedSearchSort.js`
```
Sorted list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Target 30 found at index 2
```
